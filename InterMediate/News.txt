Looking back, the first thing that the year 2020 brings to mind is the COVID-19 pandemic. However, amid all the suffering and chaos, there were definitely a few positives for the planet Earth, as the year stood as a testimony to the larger impact we could have through the planned limiting of our polluting activities.

Moreover, despite the limitations on movement, scientists kept on publishing path-breaking discoveries, some of which added to the list of existing rich biodiversity while others offered solutions to long-standing environmental challenges. Altogether, 2020 did have some bright spots in the environment front amid the pandemic, which reminded us of the importance of respecting natural boundaries.

India etches spectacular big cats conservation story with increases in population
India scored big and left no stone unturned in the conservation of its big cats—Tiger and Leopard. Moreover, by conducting the world’s largest-ever camera trap wildlife survey in the form of the Tiger Survey, India added another record to the Guinness Book of World Records in 2020.
